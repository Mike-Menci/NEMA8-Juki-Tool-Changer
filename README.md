# NEMA8 Juki Tool Changer
A Pick and Place tool changer nozzle to hold Juki 500 series nozzles on a NEMA8 hollow shaft motor. It features a triple ball lock similar to what you would find on an aircompressor fitting or domestic garden hose to properly seat the nozzle.

The tool changer has been fully tested with both SLA (on a Stratasys Objet) prints and CNC machined. There are configurations for drilled holes and for tapered holes in the SolidWorks files. The tapered holes work best for SLA printing whereas the drilled holes are best for machining. I would not recommend this part for FDM printing at all due to the feature sizes.

This is my tool changer design which Ray Kholodovsky ran an initial production run of in the OpenPNP Google Group.
